# Crypto Market Server!

Have a look at the latest version of the full app...
The server uses custom mutations and queries to connect users with their data, which is hosted on Heroku.
This readme is a work in progress. Proper links and screenshots are on the way.

## How I worked on this project

My primary goal was to demonstrate skills required to succeed in a professional work environment.

- I built this app based wireframes and feedback from potential users.
- I used my own Task Tracker as I was building it, drawing inspiration from Kanban boards: [Screenshot of tasks]

## How to navigate this project

- The application queries and mutates data from a custom MongoDB database that I built, maintain and host on Heroku: [link to code on GitHub].

## Why I built the project this way


## As I continue to work on this I intend to...

- Add unit testing with Jest and React Testing Library.
- Set up continuous integration to run tests and ESLint on every Pull Request.
- Refactor some of the code. [link to code on GitHub]
